    You are seeing this page because the website you have requested is on a
    blacklist we use to prevent you from accidently stumbling onto websites
    that contain (for example):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware">malware</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware">spyware</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus">viruses</a></li>
    <li>linked to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishing</a></li>
  </ul>

    This system is <em>not</em> designed to censor your Internet experience
    but to protect your workstation, our network equipment and also detect
    any infected computers on our network.
  </p>

  <p>
    The following links might help you discover why the website you are trying to
    access is unavailable:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=[% domain %]">Google SafeBrowsing</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://hosts-file.net/default.asp?s=[% domain %]">hpHosts</a> - slow to open</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.siteadvisor.com/sites/[% domain %]">McAfee SiteAdvisor</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://safeweb.norton.com/report/show?url=[% domain %]">Norton Safe Web</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.mywot.com/en/scorecard/[% domain %]">Web Of Trust</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you feel the website you are trying to go to should not be blacklisted
    then you should contact the support team that <u>maintain the website</u>
    with a copy of this page (File -> Save As) attached to your email.  They
    will then need to do whatever work is necessary to get themselves delisted.
    <em>Only</em> the support team who run the website can perform this task,
    nobody else can!
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>N.B.</b> do <em>not</em> contact any blacklists yourself as
    	all they do is provide a blacklist that SOAS has choosen to use.  They
	are not responsible for this decision and if you approach them yourself
	regarding whitelisting they will be unable to help.
  </p>

  <p>
    To temporarily bypass the block you can accept the risk we consider you
    will be taking in going to the site by clicking on the submission button

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>if this is not a site you have visited before then we
    	<em>strongly</em> recommend you do <em>not</em> visit it and simply
	forget it exists...</li>
    <li>we log attempts to visit blocked websites, if you decide to contine
    	and accept the risk of visiting the website we no longer log your
	traffic to it</li>
    <li>the temporarily whitelisting lasts until you close your webbrowser
    	and works by using a session-only cookie (nothing is physically
	stored on your computer)</li>
  </ul>
